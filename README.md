SoftwareMeasurementProject
=======================
The aim of this project is to measure different projects using different metrics and to co-relate them.
Here we perform various different coverage tests for developing test cases so that entire code is covered and there are no parts of the code left uncovered. The coverage helps us to make better test suites that can detect the anomalies and code mutants injected in the main code. The various coverages used to for code coverage are: 
1. Statement Coverage
2. Branch Coverage
3. Mutation Score
4. Cyclomatic Complexity
5. Metrics based Software Maintenance Effort Model
6. Software Defect Density
