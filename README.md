Correlation between metrics of Various Projects
=======================
The aim of this project is to measure different projects using different metrics and to co-relate them.
Here we perform various different coverage tests for developing test cases so that entire code is covered and there are no parts of the code left uncovered. The coverage helps us to make better test suites that can detect the anomalies and code mutants injected in the main code. The various coverages used to for code coverage are: 
1. **Statement Coverage:** measurement procedure wherein the number of lines of code covered under certain circumstances is calculated based on the inputs from the users.
2. **Branch Coverage:** Branch coverage is a measurement to calculate the number of branches executed per user input.
3. **Mutation Score:** Mutation score is a testing practice wherein we check the accuracy or precision of the test cases.
4. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Cyclomatic Complexity is the measure number of linearly independent paths that can be executed in a program.
5. **Metrics based Software Maintenance Effort Model** 
6. **Software Defect Density**
